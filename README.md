# Simulation of Rolling Ellipse

This is side project which was under taken to simulate a constrained rolling ellipse using concepts of **Lagrangians** (lagrange multiplier method), generalized coordinates, **Euler-Lagrange** equation. 

* The following procedure is followed in order to simulate a rolling ellipse in Matlab 
  * Defining coordinate systems and constraints
  * Finding the equations of motions
  * Representation of the state-space equations3
  * Simulations in Matlab.
